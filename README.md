# Todo List Website

This is a simple Todo List website that allows users to manage their tasks. It provides several key features to help users keep track of their todos effectively.

## Key Features

1. **Add Todos:** Users can easily add new tasks to their todo list. Each task includes a title and a description field.

2. **Date and Time Stamp:** When a user adds a new todo, the system automatically records the date and time at which the task was created. This feature helps users keep track of when they added each task.

3. **Delete Todos:** Users can remove specific todos from their list. This allows for easy task management and decluttering.

4. **Clear All Todos:** For convenience, there is an option to clear the entire todo list in one go. This can be helpful when users want to start fresh or have completed all their tasks.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for creating the structure and layout of the website.
